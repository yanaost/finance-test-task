# Finance Real Time tickers

## Implemented a solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

Price data is available from a locally running service (see information below). Visualisations to indicate how prices have changed.

Functionality:
- visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices
- the possibility to switch on/off tickers by user
- the possibility to specify interval time by user (partially)
- the possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
- filters to discover growing/struggling tickers

Technologies used:
- Material UI, React, Redux Toolkit with Middleware (Thunk), socket.io, Airbnb eslint


## Future features
- Testing
- Update interval functionality (for the moment data are sent to server, but not handled there)
- Few hooks are needed for optimisation, Typescript?

Prerequisites the application may look like on the [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/) page.

Important to keep in mind:
- workability: how application works
- projects structure
- code quality: readability (ESLint)
- testing

## Running the local service
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd server```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```
5. You can visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.

## Run application
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

## Run the tests
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm run test``` or ```yarn test```

# Price Service Usage

URL:
```http://localhost:4000```

Price tickers are real-time via web-sockets.
